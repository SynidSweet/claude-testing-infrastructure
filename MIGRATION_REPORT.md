## References Updated

### Files with Updated References (8 files)
1. **ai-testing-template/CLAUDE.md** - Updated refactoring and architecture references
2. **decoupled-testing-suite/CLAUDE.md** - Updated all documentation references
3. **README.md** - Updated navigation guide and quick links
4. **CLAUDE.md** (main) - Updated all internal references
5. **ADAPTER_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Updated refactoring reference
6. **docs/ai-agents/navigation.md** - Updated all documentation references
7. **docs/architecture/insights.md** - Updated cross-references
8. **All new module files** - Added cross-references between modules

### Redirect Files Created
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Now redirects to modular architecture docs
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - Now redirects to planning module

## Validation Results
- All content preserved: ✅
- Links validated: ✅
- Structure complete: ✅
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md transformed to navigation hub: ✅
- Cross-references updated: ✅
- No broken functionality: ✅

## Key Improvements
1. **Better Organization**: Documentation is now organized by topic rather than in monolithic files
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Each module file is focused on a specific topic
3. **Improved Navigation**: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md serves as a clear navigation hub
4. **Consistent Structure**: All modules follow the same pattern with "See Also" sections
5. **Preserved History**: Original files contain redirect notices to new locations

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Review the new structure at PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
2. ✅ Verify all links work correctly
3. ✅ Consider removing redirect files (ARCHITECTURE.md, REFACTORING_PLAN.md) after team adaptation
4. ✅ Update any CI/CD scripts that might reference old documentation paths
5. ✅ Continue adding new documentation to appropriate modules

## Migration Complete
The documentation migration has been completed successfully. All content has been preserved and reorganized into a more maintainable structure. The PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file now serves as an effective navigation hub for the entire documentation system.
