- [ ] Week 3 Complete (0/4 major tasks)
- [ ] MVP Ready for Release

## üéØ Definition of Done

The MVP is complete when:
1. An AI agent can clone the repo and immediately understand how to use it via README.md
2. Both approaches can be successfully used to add testing to a project
3. All scripts listed in package.json are implemented and functional
4. At least one working example exists for each approach
5. Error handling prevents common failure scenarios
6. Documentation is complete and accurate
7. All tests pass on multiple platforms

## üìù Notes

- Focus on JavaScript implementation first, then ensure Python parity
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing template approach
- Prioritize AI agent usability in all design decisions
- Keep documentation in sync with implementation
- Test frequently with real-world projects

This plan represents approximately 2-3 weeks of focused development work to bring the project to MVP completion.
