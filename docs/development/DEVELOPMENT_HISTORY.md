- **6 TEMPLATE CLASSES**: Created JavaScriptEnhancedTemplates.ts (1,700+ lines) with EnhancedJestJavaScriptTemplate, EnhancedReactComponentTemplate, EnhancedVueComponentTemplate, EnhancedAngularComponentTemplate, EnhancedTypeScriptTemplate, and EnhancedReactTypeScriptComponentTemplate
- **ASYNC PATTERN INTEGRATION**: Templates leverage AsyncPatternDetector results to generate pattern-specific tests for async/await, promises, callbacks, and generators

- **CONFIGURATION LOADING FIX**: Added missing `await configService.loadConfiguration()` calls before FileDiscoveryService creation in CLI commands
- **ERROR HANDLING ENHANCEMENT**: Improved `handleAnalysisOperation()` to capture and display actual error messages instead of empty objects
- **PRODUCTION VALIDATION RESTORED**: All test fixtures (react-es-modules, mixed-complex, mixed-minimal) now working correctly
- **CORE INFRASTRUCTURE VALIDATED**: 168/168 core tests passing, ProjectAnalyzer and StructuralTestGenerator fully functional

- **PRODUCTION READINESS**: Generated tests are now immediately executable without manual import path fixes - resolves core infrastructure issue
- **VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS**: Fixed production readiness tests to use correct `generate-logical --model` command instead of non-existent `analyze-gaps --model`

### 2025-07-01: Configuration System Investigation Complete
- **CONFIGURATION INVESTIGATION COMPLETE** - Comprehensive analysis of configuration loading issues across CLI commands
- **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: 5 of 8 CLI commands not loading user configuration files properly - only `test` command fully implements configuration loading
- **ROOT CAUSE**: No centralized ConfigurationService exists - each command implements its own ad-hoc configuration logic (or doesn't)

- **PATH RESOLUTION**: Fixed `getTestFilePath()` method using proper `path.relative()` instead of string replacement, corrected directory structure generation from `.claude-testing/code/personal/...` to `.claude-testing/tests/src/`
- **JEST CONFIGURATION**: Enhanced TestRunner working directory to use `testPath` instead of `projectPath`, added Jest configuration isolation to prevent project config conflicts, implemented node environment to avoid jsdom dependency issues
