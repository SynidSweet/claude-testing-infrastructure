## Architecture Evolution
The project evolved from a simple testing tool to a comprehensive AI-powered testing infrastructure:
1. **Initial Scope**: Basic test generation for single languages
2. **Language Adapter Pattern**: Multi-framework support (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python)
3. **AI Integration**: Claude-powered logical test generation with cost optimization
4. **Incremental System**: Git-based change detection with smart test updates
5. **Production Polish**: Dry-run mode, comprehensive error handling, timeout management
6. **Type System Enhancement**: Discriminated unions for better AI comprehension
7. **File Processing**: Chunking system for large file compatibility

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Never modify target projects, all tests external
- **Language Adapter Pattern**: Consistent interface across different programming languages
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Decomposition of god classes into focused, single-responsibility components
- **AI Cost Optimization**: Intelligent batching and incremental updates to minimize API costs
- **Type-First Development**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for better tooling and AI understanding
- **External Test Storage**: All tests stored in `.claude-testing/` directory for clean separation
