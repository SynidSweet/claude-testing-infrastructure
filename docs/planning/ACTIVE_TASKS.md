- **Outcome**: Truth validation system operational, preventing false claims and ensuring accurate documentation

## ðŸ“Š Progress Summary

- **âœ… Investigation Complete**: Root cause analysis of reporting discrepancies completed
- **âœ… Implementation Plan**: Comprehensive 16-task plan created with validation framework
- **âœ… All Phases Complete**: Infrastructure fixes, truth validation core, blocker detection, workflow integration, production validation, E2E validation all done
- **âœ… Phase 6 Complete**: Both TASK-E2E-001 and TASK-E2E-002 successfully completed
- **Progress Update**: **100% complete (16/16 tasks)** - Truth validation system fully operational

## ðŸ“‹ Active Tasks

### ðŸ”´ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Critical Production Blockers
**Current Reality** (Updated 2025-07-11):
- **Truth Validation**: âœ… Complete - All 16 tasks done
- **Test Suite**: 554/555 passing (99.8% pass rate)
- **Linting**: 7 errors, 10 warnings (blocking production)
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline failing
- **Production Score**: 0% (Critical failures: CI/CD, linting errors)

### ðŸŸ¡ NEXT PRIORITY TASKS
Based on critical production blockers identified:

1. **INT-TEST-001** - Fix Failing Integration Tests in CI/CD (2-3 hours) - Critical for production pipeline
2. **CLI-FIX-001** - Fix Run Command Configuration Loading Issue (1-2 hours) - Discovered during E2E
3. **STYLE-IMPROVE-001** - Apply Nullish Coalescing Operator Recommendations (30 minutes) - 10 linting warnings

### Recently Completed
- **CI/CD-INVESTIGATION-001 - Investigate and Fix Pipeline Failures** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Identified root cause: Node.js version mismatch (main branch using 18, package.json requiring 20) and missing husky@9.1.7 dependency. Fixed package-lock.json sync, created PR #2 with fixes. Discovered additional integration test failures (3 tests in in-memory-fs-performance.test.ts) blocking complete pipeline success. Infrastructure-level CI/CD issues resolved.
- **TASK-E2E-002 - Truth Validation System End-to-End Test** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive E2E test scripts validating entire truth validation system. Confirmed all 8 components work correctly, false claim detection operates as expected, and pre-commit hooks would prevent false commits. System now prevents documentation discrepancies. Completed all 16 tasks in Truth Validation System (100%). Completed in ~1 hour.
- **TASK-E2E-001 - Test Project Implementation Validation** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive E2E validation infrastructure with 3 test projects (JavaScript/Express, Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/React). Built validation scripts (`run-e2e-validation.js`, `comprehensive-e2e-test.js`) that validate all 5 core features with 100% pass rate. Performance validated at ~3 seconds per project. Created follow-up task CLI-FIX-001 for discovered run command issue. Completed in 45 minutes.
- **TASK-PROD-002 - Comprehensive Readiness Scoring System** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Redesigned production validation scoring with proper critical failure detection. Critical failures (CI/CD, linting errors, build) now result in 0% score. Implemented transparent score breakdown, prioritized recommendations (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and JSON output support. Fixed linting error parsing (now correctly detects 7 errors vs 1). Completed in 30 minutes.
- **TASK-PROD-001 - CI/CD Integration for Production Validation** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented enhanced production validation with CI/CD pipeline status checking. Created `scripts/production-readiness-check-enhanced.js` with GitHub API integration, deployability assessment, branch-aware logic, and comprehensive scoring with critical failure detection. Added documentation and forwarded original script. Completed in 45 minutes.
- **TASK-WORKFLOW-002 - Automated Status Documentation Updater** (2025-07-11): âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented automated system that updates status documentation based on actual project state. Created `scripts/status-documentation-updater.js` with template-based updates, audit trail tracking, dry-run mode, auto-commit capability, and JSON output. Updates both CURRENT_FOCUS.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md automatically. Completed in 30 minutes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps

**Current Focus**: Fix Critical Production Blockers

1. **LINT-CLEANUP-001** - Resolve Remaining 7 Linting Errors (2-3 hours) - ðŸ”´ Critical
   - Complex unsafe assignments requiring architectural type safety improvements
   - Blocking production deployment
   
2. **CLI-FIX-001** - Fix Run Command Configuration Loading Issue (1-2 hours) - ðŸŸ¡ Medium
   - Configuration service not initialized before FileDiscoveryService creation
   - Discovered during E2E validation but doesn't affect test generation
   
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Investigation** - Determine failure cause - ðŸ”´ Critical
   - Pipeline has been failing for 4+ days
   - Blocking automated deployments
   
**Goal**: Achieve production readiness score > 85% by fixing remaining CI/CD integration test failures
