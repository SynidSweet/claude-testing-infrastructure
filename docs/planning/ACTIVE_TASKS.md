# Active Development Tasks

*This document contains only active, pending tasks that are realistically achievable in standard development sessions (60-80 minutes)*

*Last updated: 2025-07-02 | Language-Specific Generators implementation COMPLETED - JavaScript/TypeScript generator fully integrated and production validated*

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Project Status

**Infrastructure Status**: Production-ready v2.0 with **FileDiscoveryService fully integrated**  
**Test Suite**: 195/195 core tests passing (168 + 27 new JSFrameworkDetector tests), FileDiscoveryService providing 70%+ cache hit rates  
**Priority**: **Maintenance Mode** - All critical functionality working and optimized, remaining tasks are investigation-phase items

## ðŸ“Š Task Distribution

- **High Priority**: 0 tasks
- **Medium Priority**: 0 tasks  
- **Low Priority**: 0 tasks

## âœ… All Active Tasks Completed

All pending test fix tasks have been successfully resolved.

## ðŸš« Not Included (Too Large for Standard Sessions)

The following items require investigation phases or are too large:
- âœ… ~~Configuration System Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use ConfigurationService
- âœ… ~~FileDiscoveryService Integration~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use centralized file discovery with caching
- Configuration Auto-Discovery Investigation (6+ hours)
- âœ… ~~Language-Specific Generators Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - JavaScript/TypeScript generator fully implemented and production validated
- File Discovery Architecture Overhaul Epic (25+ hours)
- Multi-Language Architecture Epic (30+ hours)
- Intelligent Test Generation System Epic (40+ hours)

These items are documented in `/docs/planning/FUTURE_WORK.md` for reference.
