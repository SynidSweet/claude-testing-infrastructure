# Active Development Tasks

*This document contains only active, pending tasks that are realistically achievable in standard development sessions (60-80 minutes)*

*Last updated: 2025-07-06 | Process Context Isolation System Phase 1 completed - compile-time safety boundaries implemented*

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Project Status

**Infrastructure Status**: Production-ready v2.0 with **Test Suite Fully Operational**  
**Test Suite**: 434/438 tests passing (99.1% success rate), runs in ~11 seconds, no API calls  
**Priority**: **TESTING SAFETY COMPLETED** - API call prevention implemented, only 4 legacy model mapping test failures remain

## ðŸ“Š Task Distribution

- **Critical Priority**: 0 tasks (All critical safety tasks completed)
- **High Priority**: 1 task (REF-ARCH-001 Phase 2-3 remaining)  
- **Medium Priority**: 1 task  
- **Low Priority**: 0 tasks

## ðŸ“‹ Active Tasks

### âœ… COMPLETED: Process Spawning Prevention
**STATUS**: All critical safety mechanisms completed with multi-layer protection

- **REF-CRITICAL-001**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Emergency Recursion Prevention - Added hard stop with aggressive error messages when DISABLE_HEADLESS_AGENTS=true
- **REF-CRITICAL-002**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-07-06) - Global Process Management Architecture - Comprehensive process coordination system with GlobalProcessManager singleton, process limits, reservation system, emergency shutdown, and cross-component integration
- **REF-ARCH-001 Phase 1**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-07-06) - Process Context Isolation System - Added ProcessContext enum with compile-time safety enforcement, ProcessContextValidator with architectural boundaries, context-aware ClaudeOrchestrator constructor

ðŸ“– **See details**: [`./docs/planning/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`](./REFACTORING_PLAN.md) for complete implementation plans

### Recently Completed
- **TEST-SAFETY-001**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-07-06) - Fixed test suite API call issue consuming Claude quota. Updated package.json to enforce `DISABLE_HEADLESS_AGENTS=true` for all test commands, preventing external API calls and enabling fast test execution.
- **TASK-TEST-003 & TASK-TEST-004**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Fixed constructor call errors and React/JSX configuration in generated tests (class detection, proper instantiation, jest-dom setup)
- **TASK-CICD-001**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Systematic CI/CD failure resolution (model recognition integration, framework auto-detection, template engine compatibility fixes)

## ðŸš« Not Included (Too Large for Standard Sessions)

The following items require investigation phases or are too large:
- âœ… ~~Configuration System Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use ConfigurationService
- âœ… ~~FileDiscoveryService Integration~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use centralized file discovery with caching
- Configuration Auto-Discovery Investigation (6+ hours)
- âœ… ~~Language-Specific Generators Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - JavaScript/TypeScript generator fully implemented and production validated
- File Discovery Architecture Overhaul Epic (25+ hours)
- Multi-Language Architecture Epic (30+ hours)
- Intelligent Test Generation System Epic (40+ hours)

These items are documented in `/docs/planning/FUTURE_WORK.md` for reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps

1. **In Progress**: Language-Specific Generators Implementation
   - âœ… TASK-LANG-001: Base abstractions (completed)
   - âœ… TASK-LANG-002a: Basic JavaScriptTestGenerator (completed)

   - âœ… TASK-LANG-002c: JSFrameworkDetector (completed)
   - âœ… TASK-LANG-002d: Async Pattern Detector (completed)
   - âœ… TASK-LANG-002e: Enhanced JavaScript Templates (completed)
   - âœ… TASK-LANG-002f: Integration and Real-World Testing (completed)
   - **Complete**: JavaScript/TypeScript test generator fully implemented and validated
