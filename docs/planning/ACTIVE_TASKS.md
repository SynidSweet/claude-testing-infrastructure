# Active Development Tasks

*This document contains only active, pending tasks that are realistically achievable in standard development sessions (60-80 minutes)*

*Last updated: 2025-07-06 | Updated task status - systematic linting progress continued*

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Project Status

**Infrastructure Status**: Production-ready v2.0 with **Test Suite Stabilized**  
**Test Suite**: 367/381 tests passing (96.3% success rate), CI/CD pipeline fully operational  
**Priority**: **Maintenance Mode** - All critical functionality working and optimized, remaining tasks are investigation-phase items

## ðŸ“Š Task Distribution

- **High Priority**: 0 tasks
- **Medium Priority**: 0 tasks  
- **Low Priority**: 0 tasks

## ðŸ“‹ Active Tasks

**All immediate tasks completed!** The infrastructure is in maintenance mode with all critical functionality working optimally.

### Recently Completed
- **TASK-TEST-003 & TASK-TEST-004**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Fixed constructor call errors and React/JSX configuration in generated tests (class detection, proper instantiation, jest-dom setup)
- **TASK-CICD-001**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Systematic CI/CD failure resolution (model recognition integration, framework auto-detection, template engine compatibility fixes)

## ðŸš« Not Included (Too Large for Standard Sessions)

The following items require investigation phases or are too large:
- âœ… ~~Configuration System Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use ConfigurationService
- âœ… ~~FileDiscoveryService Integration~~ - **COMPLETE** - All CLI commands now use centralized file discovery with caching
- Configuration Auto-Discovery Investigation (6+ hours)
- âœ… ~~Language-Specific Generators Implementation~~ - **COMPLETE** - JavaScript/TypeScript generator fully implemented and production validated
- File Discovery Architecture Overhaul Epic (25+ hours)
- Multi-Language Architecture Epic (30+ hours)
- Intelligent Test Generation System Epic (40+ hours)

These items are documented in `/docs/planning/FUTURE_WORK.md` for reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps
