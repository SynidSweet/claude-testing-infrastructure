# Current Priorities & Roadmap

*Last updated: 2025-06-28 | Focused on single decoupled approach*

## ðŸš¨ Strategic Pivot (2025-06-27)

**MAJOR CHANGE**: Transitioning from dual-approach to single decoupled-only infrastructure with AI-powered test generation.

### Immediate Priority: Single Approach Implementation
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks (see `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_COMPLETE.md`)
- **Goal**: True testing infrastructure that updates via `git pull`
- **Key Features**: 
  - Zero project modification
  - AI-powered logical test generation
  - Incremental testing with smart change detection
  - Cost-efficient continuous updates

## Active Development Areas

### Current Phase: Architecture Transition
- **Status**: Planning complete, ready for implementation
- **Focus**: Removing template-based approach, enhancing decoupled suite
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Archive template-based code
  2. Implement core infrastructure (Week 1-2)
  3. Add AI integration (Week 3-4)
  4. Build incremental system (Week 5)
  5. Polish and release (Week 6)

### Completed Transitions
- âœ… Non-interactive initialization (completed)
- ðŸ”„ Template-based approach removal (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ Documentation simplification (in progress)

## Upcoming Features (Post-Transition)

### Version 1.0 (After 6-week implementation)
- âœ¨ **AI-Powered Test Generation**
  - Structural tests via static analysis
  - Logical tests via Claude integration
  - Gap analysis and intelligent coverage
- ðŸ“ˆ **Incremental Testing**
  - Git-based change detection
  - Smart regeneration (only what changed)
  - Cost tracking and optimization
- ðŸ”§ **Core Infrastructure**
  - Project analysis engine
  - Multi-language support (JS/TS/Python)
  - External test execution
  - Coverage reporting

### Version 1.1 (Future)
- Additional language support (Go, Rust, Java)
- VS Code extension
- GitHub Actions integration
- Advanced performance testing

### Version 2.0 (Long-term)
- Cloud-based execution
- Team collaboration features
- ML-powered test improvement
- Custom training capabilities

## Technical Improvements Needed

### High Priority (During Implementation)
- Implement parallel Claude process management
- Create efficient AST parsing system
- Build robust state management (.claude-testing/)
- Design cost-effective prompt strategies

### Medium Priority
- Performance optimization for large codebases
- Advanced caching mechanisms
- Better error aggregation and reporting
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Low Priority (Post-1.0)
- Visual regression testing
- Security testing integration
- Mutation testing support
- Property-based testing

## Success Metrics

### For Version 1.0
- âœ… <3 minute analysis for average project
- âœ… >90% structural test coverage
- âœ… <$1 for incremental updates
- âœ… Zero modifications to target project
- âœ… Support for JS/TS/Python
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation

### Long-term Goals
- Industry-standard testing infrastructure
- Adopted by AI coding assistants
- Community-driven improvements
- Self-sustaining through efficiency
