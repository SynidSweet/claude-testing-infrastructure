# Implementation Plan

*Last updated: 2025-07-13 | No active implementation tasks - focus remains on refactoring and production hardening*

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Phase**: Production Hardening (Phase 3)
**Priority**: Architecture modernization and production readiness

## 📋 Active Implementation Tasks

### 🔴 High Priority Features

*Currently no high priority feature implementations - focus on refactoring and hardening*

### 🟡 Medium Priority Features

*Features planned after current refactoring work completes*

### 🟢 Low Priority Features

*Nice-to-have features for future consideration*

## 📝 Feature Request Template

## 🔄 Implementation Workflow

1. **Feature Request** → Add to this document
2. **Design Review** → Technical design approval
3. **Implementation** → Follow development workflow
4. **Testing** → Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation** → Update all relevant docs
6. **Release** → Version bump and changelog

## ⚠️ Implementation Guidelines

- **No new features during refactoring** - Stability first
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - Don't break existing users
- **Feature flags** - For gradual rollout
- **Performance impact** - Measure before/after
- **Security review** - For user-facing features
