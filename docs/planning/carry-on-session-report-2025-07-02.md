# Carry-On Session Report

## Task Completed
- **Task ID**: Language-Specific Test Generators - Investigation Phase
- **Title**: Investigate language-specific test generation requirements
- **Time**: 8 hours estimated (Actual: ~70 minutes)
- **Status**: Completed - Investigation Phase Complete

## Work Summary
Completed a comprehensive investigation into language-specific test generation patterns, analyzing the current single-generator system and documenting requirements for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python specific generators. Created detailed architecture design and migration plan with 10 actionable implementation tasks.

## Key Changes
- Created `docs/planning/language-specific-test-patterns-investigation.md` - Phase 1 requirements analysis
- Created `docs/planning/language-specific-generators-architecture-design.md` - Phase 2 architecture design
- Created `docs/planning/language-specific-generators-migration-plan.md` - Phase 3 migration planning
- Updated `docs/planning/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` to mark investigation as complete

## Testing Results
- **Test Infrastructure**: Found
- **Test Command**: npm test
- **Test Status**: Failed - Pre-existing failures unrelated to documentation changes
- **Test Duration**: 12.447s
- **Test Summary**: 35 failed, 210 passed (245 total) - failures appear to be pre-existing issues
- **Failures**: Configuration precedence tests and production readiness validation tests

## Discoveries
1. **Current Architecture Limitations**: Single generator uses same logic for all languages, with differentiation only at template level
2. **Language-Specific Needs**: JavaScript requires module system detection, async patterns, framework-specific handling; Python needs import analysis, fixture detection, decorator support
3. **Template System Inadequacy**: Current template-only approach cannot handle the complexity of language-specific patterns
4. **AST Analysis Required**: Proper test generation requires language-specific AST parsing and analysis

## Follow-up Tasks Created
The migration plan includes 10 implementation tasks totaling ~70 hours:
1. TASK-LANG-001: Core Abstractions (8 hours)
2. TASK-LANG-002: JavaScript Generator (12 hours)
3. TASK-LANG-003: Python Generator (12 hours)
4. TASK-LANG-004: Template Enhancement (6 hours)
5. TASK-LANG-005: Feature Flags (4 hours)
6. TASK-LANG-006: Compatibility Layer (6 hours)
7. TASK-LANG-007: Migration Tools (8 hours)
8. TASK-LANG-008: Performance Optimization (6 hours)
9. TASK-LANG-009: Integration Testing (8 hours)
10. TASK-LANG-010: Documentation Update (6 hours)

## Next Recommended Action
Begin implementation with TASK-LANG-001 (Core Abstractions) as it provides the foundation for all other tasks. This is an 8-hour task suitable for 3-4 development sessions. The investigation has provided clear specifications for implementation.
