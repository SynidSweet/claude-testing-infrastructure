### Before/After Code Structure
```typescript
// BEFORE: Unsafe any types
function processResult(result: any) {
  return result.data.items.map((item: any) => item.value);
}

// AFTER: Type-safe interfaces
interface ProcessResult {
  data: {
    items: Array<{ value: string }>;
  };
}

function processResult(result: ProcessResult): string[] {
  return result.data.items.map(item => item.value);
}
```

*This refactoring plan represents a comprehensive analysis of the codebase with specific, actionable recommendations for improving maintainability, reducing complexity, and optimizing for AI agent development. Each task is designed to be completable by an AI agent while providing significant value to the overall codebase quality.*

**UPDATED (2025-06-30)**: Added critical user feedback driven tasks from real-world testing. These tasks now take priority over investigation-phase items to address immediate user experience blockers.

**EMERGENCY UPDATE (2025-06-30)**: Added critical test generation pipeline failure task based on systematic error analysis. This task now takes highest priority as it addresses core infrastructure failure making the system unusable.

**MIGRATION UPDATE (2025-07-07)**: Added comprehensive TypeScript improvement tasks from migration analysis - 24 new tasks ranging from simple type fixes to epic architectural improvements, totaling 45-65 hours of systematic improvements.
