## üìà Strategic Considerations

Before undertaking any epic task:
1. **Validate Need**: Ensure there's real user demand
2. **Prototype First**: Build small proof-of-concept
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Break into smaller deliverables
4. **Measure Impact**: Define success metrics upfront
5. **Community Input**: Get feedback before major changes

## üéØ Recommended Approach

1. **Short-term**: Focus on moderate tasks in ACTIVE_TASKS.md
2. **Medium-term**: Conduct investigations during quieter periods
3. **Long-term**: Only pursue epics with clear business value
4. **Continuous**: Gather user feedback to prioritize correctly
