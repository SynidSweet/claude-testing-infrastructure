# Planning Archive - AI Agent Guide

*Quick navigation for AI agents working with archived planning documents and completed tasks*

## üéØ Purpose

This guide helps AI agents understand and navigate archived planning documentation, including completed tasks, obsolete implementation plans, and historical project decisions. Use this when you need context about past work or are researching project evolution.

## üìã Archive Documentation Structure

### Document Organization
```
archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPLETED_TASKS_2025.md                    # Completed tasks from 2025
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DECOUPLED_ONLY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md      # Completed implementation plan
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_COMPLETE.md            # Legacy implementation plan
```

### Archive Categories

#### Completed Tasks (`COMPLETED_TASKS_2025.md`)
**Purpose**: Historical record of completed development tasks  
**When to reference**: Understanding what has been accomplished, patterns of past work  
**Key content**: Completed features, resolved issues, implementation details

#### Implementation Plans (Multiple files)
**Purpose**: Historical implementation strategies and approaches  
**When to reference**: Understanding past architectural decisions, learning from previous approaches  
**Key content**: Technical strategies, decision rationale, implementation approaches

## üîç Working with Archived Documentation

### Understanding Project History

#### Evolution Tracking
1. **Task completion patterns** - What types of work have been done
2. **Implementation approaches** - How features were built in the past
3. **Decision context** - Why certain approaches were chosen
4. **Success patterns** - What worked well in previous implementations

#### Historical Context
```markdown
# Typical archive research flow
1. Identify the timeframe or feature of interest
2. Check completed tasks for implementation details
3. Review implementation plans for decision context
4. Understand patterns that can inform current work
```

### Archive Research Patterns

#### Learning from Past Work
1. **Similar features** - How were similar problems solved before?
2. **Implementation patterns** - What approaches were successful?
3. **Decision rationale** - Why were certain choices made?
4. **Lessons learned** - What challenges were encountered?

#### Context for Current Work
1. **Avoid duplication** - Ensure new work doesn't repeat completed tasks
2. **Learn from mistakes** - Understand what didn't work well
3. **Apply patterns** - Use successful approaches from past work
4. **Maintain consistency** - Follow established patterns and decisions

## üìä Archive Navigation Best Practices

### Research Strategies

#### Finding Relevant Information
1. **Start with timeframe** - When was similar work done?
2. **Search by feature** - What tasks relate to current work?
3. **Look for patterns** - How were similar problems approached?
4. **Check decision context** - Why were certain choices made?

#### Information Extraction
1. **Key decisions** - What architectural choices were made?
2. **Implementation details** - How were features actually built?
3. **Challenges faced** - What problems were encountered?
4. **Success factors** - What made implementations successful?

### Documentation Maintenance

#### Archive Organization
1. **Chronological order** - Maintain clear timeline of completed work
2. **Clear categorization** - Group related tasks and plans together
3. **Context preservation** - Keep decision rationale and background
4. **Link maintenance** - Ensure references to current docs work

#### What Gets Archived
- **Completed task lists** - When planning documents are cleaned up
- **Obsolete implementation plans** - When approaches are superseded
- **Decision documents** - When decisions are finalized and documented elsewhere
- **Temporary planning docs** - When work phases are completed

## üîß Common Archive Research Tasks

### Understanding Feature History
1. **Find related completed tasks** - Search archive for similar features
2. **Review implementation approaches** - Understand how features were built
3. **Extract patterns** - Identify reusable approaches and decisions
4. **Document lessons** - Apply learnings to current work

### Decision Context Research
1. **Locate decision documents** - Find archived implementation plans
2. **Understand rationale** - Why were certain approaches chosen?
3. **Check alternatives** - What other options were considered?
4. **Apply context** - Use insights for current decisions

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Identify successful patterns** - What approaches worked well?
2. **Note recurring challenges** - What problems appear repeatedly?
3. **Extract best practices** - What can be standardized?
4. **Avoid known issues** - What should be avoided based on experience?

### Avoiding Duplication
1. **Search completed tasks** - Has this work been done before?
2. **Check implementation plans** - Is there existing strategy for this?
3. **Review decision history** - Have similar decisions been made?
4. **Understand evolution** - How has the approach changed over time?

## üö® Archive Quality Standards

### Information Preservation
- **Complete context** - All relevant background information
- **Decision rationale** - Why choices were made
- **Implementation details** - How work was actually done
- **Lessons learned** - What was discovered during implementation

### Organization Principles
- **Clear dating** - When work was completed
- **Proper categorization** - Logical grouping of related items
- **Cross-references** - Links to current documentation
- **Search-friendly** - Easy to find relevant information

## üîÑ Archive Integration Patterns

### Research to Implementation
1. **Archive research** - Understand past approaches
2. **Pattern extraction** - Identify reusable elements
3. **Current application** - Apply learnings to new work
4. **Documentation update** - Update current docs with new insights

### Continuous Learning
1. **Regular review** - Periodically check archive for insights
2. **Pattern documentation** - Document successful patterns in current docs
3. **Decision history** - Reference past decisions in new choices
4. **Knowledge transfer** - Share archive insights with development

### Historical Context
