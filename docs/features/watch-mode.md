# Watch Mode

*Last updated: 2025-07-02 | Feature Status: ✅ Production Ready | Added optional process monitoring integration*

## Overview

Watch Mode provides real-time file monitoring with automatic incremental test generation, transforming the development workflow from manual to automatic test updates. This feature dramatically improves developer experience by providing instant feedback as code changes.

## Core Functionality

### Real-time File Monitoring
- **Cross-platform file watching** using `chokidar` for reliability
- **Intelligent filtering** to watch only relevant source files
- **Configurable patterns** for include/exclude file patterns
- **Graceful startup and shutdown** with proper cleanup

### Smart Change Detection
- **Debounced processing** to avoid excessive test generation
- **Batch processing** of multiple file changes
- **Change type detection** (add, modify, delete)
- **Configurable debounce timing** (default: 500ms)

### Automatic Test Generation
- **Seamless integration** with existing `IncrementalGenerator`
- **Live progress feedback** with spinners and status updates
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Optional test execution** after generation

## CLI Interface

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start watching a project
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project

# Watch with custom debounce delay
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project --debounce 1000

# Watch without automatic test generation (monitoring only)
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project --no-generate

# Enable automatic test execution after generation
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project --auto-run

# Enable process monitoring for resource usage tracking
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project --monitor-processes
```

- Event merging for duplicate file changes
- Force processing for large batches or time limits

**Configuration Options**:
```typescript
{
  delay: 500,           // Debounce delay in ms
  maxBatchSize: 10,     // Force process if batch exceeds size
  maxWaitTime: 3000,    // Force process after max wait time
  groupBy: 'extension', // Group by file extension
  verbose: false        // Enable debug logging
}
```

### Watch Command (`src/cli/commands/watch.ts`)
**Purpose**: Complete watch mode implementation with user interface

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive CLI option handling
- Live status display with progress indicators
- Statistics tracking and periodic reporting
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- Integration with existing incremental system

### Process Monitoring Integration ✅ NEW
**Purpose**: Optional system resource monitoring during watch mode for debugging performance issues.

**Usage**:
```bash
node dist/cli/index.js watch /path/to/project --monitor-processes
```

**Key Features**:
- **Resource warnings** displayed in periodic statistics
- **Testing-focused filtering** to identify relevant processes
- **Non-intrusive monitoring** that doesn't impact watch performance
- **Manual debugging guidance** with references to monitor command

**Statistics Display**:
```
📊 Watch Statistics
   Uptime: 45m 12s
   Changes: 23 events, 8 batches
   Generations: 8 (100% success)
   Last activity: 2m ago
   ⚠️  3 high-resource processes detected
   💡 Run 'claude-testing monitor' for details
```

**Process Detection**:
- **CPU threshold**: 30% (lower than standalone monitor for watch mode)
- **Memory threshold**: 200MB (lower sensitivity for continuous monitoring)
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest, pytest, mocha, and other testing processes
- **Resource guidance**: Automatic suggestion to use dedicated monitor command

**Benefits**:
- **Early warning system** for resource issues during development
- **Seamless integration** with existing watch mode workflow
- **Zero performance impact** - monitoring runs asynchronously
- **User education** about available debugging tools

## Integration Points

4. **Enable auto-run** for continuous validation when ready

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use exclude patterns** to ignore irrelevant files
2. **Adjust debounce timing** based on typing speed
3. **Monitor batch sizes** to optimize processing
4. **Use --no-generate** for pure monitoring scenarios

### Error Recovery
1. **Check file permissions** if watching fails to start
2. **Verify include/exclude patterns** if too many/few files watched
3. **Monitor logs** for file system or test generation errors
4. **Restart watch mode** if persistent issues occur
