# Current Project Focus

*Last updated: 2025-07-12 | Updated by: /document command | Production validation script fixed, deployability restored - Infrastructure ready for production*

## üéØ Primary Objective  
**Truth Validation System COMPLETE - CI/CD pipeline infrastructure issues RESOLVED. Project ready for production deployment with accurate status tracking and reliable CI/CD pipeline.**

## ‚úÖ Validation Criteria
Achievement is measured by completing ALL of these:
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 1 Complete**: All 4 infrastructure fix tasks completed with validation (TASK-INFRA-001 through 004)
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 2 Complete**: Truth validation system core implemented with validation (TASK-TRUTH-001 through 003)
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 3 Complete**: Systematic blocker detection implemented with validation (TASK-BLOCKER-001 through 003) - All 3 complete
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 4 Complete**: Integrated workflow implemented with validation (TASK-WORKFLOW-001 through 002) - All 2 complete
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 5 Complete**: Enhanced production readiness validation implemented (TASK-PROD-001 through 002) - All 2 complete
- [‚úÖ] **Phase 6 Complete**: End-to-end validation successful with real test project (TASK-E2E-001 and TASK-E2E-002 complete)
- [‚úÖ] **System Operational**: Truth validation system prevents false claims and accurately tracks status
- [‚úÖ] **Documentation Accurate**: All documentation claims match reality as verified by truth validation system

## üìã Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Complete implementation of all 16 tasks from Truth Validation System Implementation Plan
- Node.js version compatibility fixes for CI/CD pipeline
- Package dependency synchronization
- Systematic linting error resolution
- Documentation accuracy audit and corrections
- Status aggregator core engine development
- Documentation claim parser implementation
- Truth validation engine with discrepancy detection
- Test suite, infrastructure, and code quality blocker detectors
- Pre-commit truth validation hooks
- Automated status documentation updater
- CI/CD integration for production validation
- Comprehensive readiness scoring system
- Test project implementation validation
- End-to-end truth validation system testing

### Out of Scope
- New feature development beyond truth validation system
- Performance optimizations not required for validation
- Documentation improvements beyond accuracy requirements
- Refactoring for code quality unless blocking validation criteria
- "Nice to have" improvements or enhancements
- Additional testing infrastructure beyond what's needed for validation
- UI/UX improvements
- Additional CLI commands or functionality
- Architecture changes not directly serving truth validation

**Phase 5 Results**: ‚úÖ TASK-PROD-001 (CI/CD Integration for Production Validation implemented), ‚úÖ TASK-PROD-002 (Comprehensive Readiness Scoring System implemented)
**Phase 6 Results**: ‚úÖ TASK-E2E-001 (Test Project Implementation Validation completed), ‚úÖ TASK-E2E-002 (Truth Validation System End-to-End Test completed)
**Result**: Truth validation system complete (16/16 tasks done, 100%), accurately preventing false claims and ensuring documentation accuracy
**CI/CD Status**: Pipeline infrastructure fixed - configuration loading resolved, integration tests passing, ready for production validation
## üìù Focus Guidelines
1. All work must directly contribute to completing the 16 implementation tasks
2. Each task must be completed with full validation before marking complete
3. No new features or improvements unless explicitly required for truth validation system
4. Phase-by-phase completion - do not skip ahead without completing dependencies
5. Validation steps must be executed and documented for each task
6. Any deviations from implementation plan require explicit focus revision

## üîÑ Focus History
- 2025-07-11: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 beginning - Truth Validation System Implementation Structure
- 2025-07-11: Documentation accuracy audit completed (TASK-INFRA-004)
- Previous focus: Production readiness investigation revealed systematic documentation discrepancies
