*Last updated: 2025-06-29 | Updated by: /document command | Python import syntax fix completed*

## Recent Updates

- **2025-06-29 (Latest Session)**: ✅ **PYTHON IMPORT SYNTAX FIX COMPLETED!**
  - **Critical Bug Resolution**:
    - ✅ **Fixed Import Errors**: Python test files had malformed import statements causing syntax errors
    - ✅ **Root Cause**: Module names were using only filename instead of full Python module path
    - ✅ **Empty Export Handling**: Fixed `from module import ` syntax errors when files have no exports
    - ✅ **Class Name Sanitization**: Fixed invalid Python class names containing dots
  - **Code Changes**:
    - ✅ **StructuralTestGenerator**: Added `calculatePythonModulePath()` to convert file paths to module paths
    - ✅ **Python Templates**: Updated to handle empty exports with `import module` syntax
    - ✅ **Template Engine**: Added `sanitizeClassName()` to convert dots to underscores in class names
    - ✅ **All Python Templates**: Fixed PytestTemplate, PytestFastApiTemplate, and PytestDjangoTemplate
  - **Impact**:
    - ✅ **Module Paths**: `src/utils/helper.py` → `from src.utils.helper import ...`
    - ✅ **Empty Exports**: Files with no exports use `import module` instead of malformed `from module import`
    - ✅ **Class Names**: `TestSrc.utils.helper` → `TestSrc_utils_helper` (valid Python syntax)
    - ✅ **Test Suite**: 117/117 tests passing (100% success rate maintained)
  - **User Impact**:
    - ✅ Addresses highest priority issue from iterative testing phase feedback

    - ✅ **Root Cause**: `getTestFileExtension()` was using project's primary language instead of individual file's language
    - ✅ **Solution**: Updated method to accept optional language parameter for file-specific extensions
    - ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Optional parameter maintains API compatibility with existing code
  - **Code Changes**:
    - ✅ **TestGenerator Base Class**: Updated `getTestFileExtension()` to accept `language?: string` parameter
