# Project Overview

## Core Purpose
- **What this project does**: Provides two comprehensive testing solutions for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python projects - an AI-agent-friendly testing template repository and a decoupled testing suite that operates independently from project source code
- **Target users**: AI agents, developers, and teams who want to implement comprehensive testing with minimal setup time and maximum maintainability
- **Business value**: Reduces testing setup from hours to minutes, enables test-first development, and provides future-proof testing infrastructure that evolves independently
- **Current status**: MVP COMPLETE âœ… Both template-based and decoupled approaches are fully functional with all promised features implemented

## Key Success Metrics
- Test setup time reduced from hours to minutes (target: <10 minutes)
- Achieve >80% test coverage in all example projects
- Support 5+ common project structures (React, Vue, Node.js, Python backends)
- Zero-error initialization in 95% of standard projects
- AI agents consistently implement testing without additional prompting
