# Project Overview

## Core Purpose
- **What this project does**: Provides AI-powered decoupled testing infrastructure for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python projects that generates comprehensive tests without modifying target projects
- **Target users**: AI agents, developers, and teams who want to implement comprehensive testing with minimal setup time and maximum maintainability
- **Business value**: Reduces testing setup from days to minutes, achieves 80%+ coverage, and provides future-proof testing infrastructure that evolves independently via git pull
- **Current status**: PRODUCTION-READY âœ… Decoupled approach fully validated with 125/125 tests passing, all major user issues resolved, autonomous development session confirms maintenance mode

## Key Success Metrics
- Test setup time reduced from hours to minutes (target: <10 minutes)
- Achieve >80% test coverage in all example projects
- Support 5+ common project structures (React, Vue, Node.js, Python backends)
- Zero-error initialization in 95% of standard projects
- AI agents consistently implement testing without additional prompting
