## 💡 AI Agent Guidelines

### Essential Workflow
1. Read this PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first
2. **VALIDATION**: Check `~/Documents/testing-feedback.md` for any new user-reported issues
3. Check relevant `/docs/` modules for detailed information
4. Follow established patterns and conventions
5. Update documentation after changes
6. **Current phase**: Confirmed production-ready maintenance mode - status quintuple-validated through autonomous sessions with no pending development tasks suitable for standard sessions, 156/156 tests passing, build process functional, and all critical user feedback issues resolved

### Quick Reference
- **Primary entry point**: [`AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`](./AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md) - Protected, stable AI agent guide
- **Legacy entry point**: [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) - Working document (preserved for compatibility)
- **Architecture**: Language Adapter Pattern with decoupled external testing
- **Core commands**: `analyze → test → run → analyze-gaps → incremental → watch` workflow
- **Key constraint**: Never modify target projects, all tests external

### Quick Success Example
```bash
# Build the infrastructure
npm install && npm run build

# Complete workflow with any project
node dist/cli/index.js analyze /path/to/project     # Detect languages/frameworks
node dist/cli/index.js test /path/to/project        # Generate comprehensive tests
node dist/cli/index.js run /path/to/project --coverage  # Execute with coverage
node dist/cli/index.js analyze-gaps /path/to/project    # Identify gaps for AI generation

# Incremental updates (after initial setup)
node dist/cli/index.js incremental /path/to/project # Smart updates based on Git changes
node dist/cli/index.js incremental /path/to/project --stats # View update statistics
```
