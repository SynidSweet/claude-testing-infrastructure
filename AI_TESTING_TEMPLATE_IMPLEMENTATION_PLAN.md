## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1-2**: Core infrastructure and JavaScript templates (highest priority)
2. **Phase 4**: Agent documentation (critical for adoption)
3. **Phase 3**: Python templates (important for completeness)
4. **Phase 5**: Example projects (essential for validation)
5. **Phase 6-8**: Advanced features and polish (nice-to-have)

### Development Approach
- Test early and often using the template system on itself
- Focus on the 80% common case before handling edge cases
- Keep agent-first design principles at the forefront
- Validate every piece of documentation with actual AI agents
